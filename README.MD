# Showces: The Loom & Screen.Studio Lovechild (WIP)

**Showces** is a powerful web extension for screen recording, inspired by the best of Loom and Screen.Studio. It lets you capture your screen with ease, just like Loom, but with an ambitious vision: to add AI magic and turn your recordings into **"awesome magical launches."** 

**Current Features:**

* Easy screen recording with options for your entire screen, specific windows, or browser tabs.
* Simple recording controls: start, stop, enable camera and record audio.
* Download your recordings as high-quality video files.

**Upcoming Features (Under Development):**

* **AI-powered Launch Magic:**  This is where Showces truly shines. Imagine your screen recording being automatically transformed into a captivating launch video. We're building AI functionality that will:
    * **Add intros, outros, and transitions** for a professional touch.
    * **Intelligently highlight key areas** of your screen for better focus.
    * **Generate captions or voice-overs** to enhance your message.

**This is just the beginning!** We are dedicated to making Showces the ultimate tool for creating engaging screen recordings. 

**Installation:**
